# GPTBLOX - Collect and Categorize the World's Released GPTs

I have launched a GPT navigation website, GPTBLOX, aggregating and categorizing 8,718 GPTs, aiming to provide a better user experience and unearth AI era opportunities. What opportunities do you see in the categorization of these 8,718 GPTs?

## Features and Services
1. **Categorization of GPTs**: All GPTs are not on a single page to avoid overwhelming users and slow page loads. From the GPT Store page displayed at the OpenAI conference, I extracted eight main categories: Productivity, DALL-E, Writing, Programming, Data Analysis, Education, Lifestyle, and Just for Fun. Subsequently, I added 32 subcategories under these main categories using ChatGPT, and then categorized the 8,718 GPTs, completing the import of all links with some tools and WordPress functionality.

2. **WordPress Search Functionality**: The website, besides aggregating GPTs, must add value to users. Therefore, it provides a search function to easily find needed GPTs. If feasible in the future, more GPT-related data including traffic, usage, and reviews will be collected and provided to help users identify valuable GPTs or analyze opportunities in various fields.

3. **Easy GPTs Submission Entry**: This feature provides a straightforward method for users to submit their own GPTs to the site.

Currently, the site features over 8,718 GPTs. Despite the limited data and the possibility of imprecise categorization by ChatGPT, there's visible data on the booming trend of GPTs:

1. **Category Insights**: In the 32 subcategories created by ChatGPT, "Knowledge Enhancement" and "Learning Tools" under Education, and "Business Intelligence" under Data Analysis have the most GPTs. Also, "Games and Entertainment" in Just for Fun, "Health and Wellness" in Lifestyle, and "Educational Resources" in Programming are well-represented. These GPTs haven't been personally tested yet, and current data might not be conclusive, but there seems to be an advantage in having existing prompts and custom instructions for quick GPT creation.

2. **Specialized GPTs**: Fields like programming tools, image processing, data statistics and modeling, script writing, and educational games have fewer GPTs, indicating potential areas for development. For instance, searching for PDF, Amazon, Etsy, TikTok, Roblox-related GPTs reveals existing but few GPTs in these areas.

3. **Language Distribution**: The majority of the 8,718 GPTs are in English, followed by Japanese, then Chinese (including Traditional), with minor languages being rare. There's potential in developing GPTs for minor languages due to lower competition.

4. **Exploring GPTs**: Browsing through others' GPTs often reveals unexpected or intriguing finds, which can inspire the development of our own GPTs.
